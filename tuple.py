A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. Tuples are similar to lists, but with a key difference: once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. Tuples are defined using parentheses ().
Key features of tuples:

Immutability: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation. This makes tuples suitable for representing fixed collections of values.

Ordered: Tuples maintain the order of elements, meaning the order in which elements are defined is preserved.
