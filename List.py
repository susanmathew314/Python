# # A Python list is a versatile, ordered collection of elements.
# # Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their contents by adding, removing, or changing elements.
# # Lists can contain elements of different data types, making them flexible and powerful for a wide range of tasks.
# #A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. Tuples are similar to lists, but with a key difference: once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. Tuples are defined using parentheses ().
# # Key features of tuples:
#
# # Immutability: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation. This makes tuples suitable for representing fixed collections of values.
#
# # Ordered: Tuples maintain the order of elements, meaning the order in which elements are defined is preserved.
